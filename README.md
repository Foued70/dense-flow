# dense-flow
Dense Optical Flow extraction rewritten from https://github.com/wanglimin/dense_flow

The tool has been rewritten to be compatible with OpenCV 3.0. Make sure you compile OpenCV with CUDA capabilities.
If you installed OpenCV to a non-default path, please edit Makefile.config and edit the paths correspondingly.

To compile, create 'build' directory, and run 'make'.
